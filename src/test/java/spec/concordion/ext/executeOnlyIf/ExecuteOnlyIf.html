<h1>Optionally Exclude Tests</h1>

<p>
	There are times that parts of a specification cannot be run and it is useful to skip these tests and mark them as "ignored" in the specification.
	Typically this will result in the element being displayed in grey (depending on the CSS stylesheet). 
</p> 

<div class="example">
	<h3>Example 1: Execute</h3>
	<i>The following should be coloured green for the first test and red for the second test</i>
	
	<div ext:executeOnlyIf="shouldExecute()">
		<p>This should be <span c:assertTrue="shouldExecute()">successful</span></p>
		<p>This should <span c:assertTrue="shouldNotExecute()">fail</span></p>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Example 2: Do Not Execute</h3>
	<i>The following two tests should ignored (ie not executed) and coloured grey</i>
	
	<div ext:executeOnlyIf="shouldNotExecute()">
		<p>This should be <span c:assertTrue="shouldExecute()">successful</span></p>
		<p>This should <span c:assertTrue="shouldNotExecute()">fail</span></p>
	</div>
